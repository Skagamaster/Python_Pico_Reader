# Python_Pico_Reader
Low level PicoDst reader in native Python using uproot and awkward arrays. This needs so much work to be considered fully functional that it's laughable to call it a PicoDst reader, but it'll work for simple things.
Functionality is being added bit by bit, so check back (or, better yet, contribute!).

## Installation
Install with `pip install .`
